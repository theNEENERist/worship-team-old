Above All
LENNY LeBLANC and PAUL BALOCHE

Above all powers, above all kings,
above all nature and all created things;
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
You were here before the world began.
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,
above all wonders the world has ever known;
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
there’s no way to measure what You’re worth.

Crucified, laid behind the stone;
You lived to die, rejected and alone;
like a rose, trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me above all.
